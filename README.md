## The Full Angular-Meteor Tutorial

Definitely worth the work!

Notes
-----

To prepare Meteor for real world use remove these packages:
	* meteor remove insecure (removes permit all as default Collections security/behavior)
	* meteor remove autopublish (disables explicit publishing of documents)

Add these packages:
	* meteor add accounts-password (enables user level Collections security)

My Tweaks
---------

Skipped steps 10 & 11, but if you've never deployed a Meteor app for public consumption, or wired it for PhoneGap and Android support DO these chapters!
